Tomato leaf mold is typically only an issue in greenhouse and high-tunnel tomatoes. The disease is driven by high relative humidity (greater than 85%). Foliage is often the only part of the plant directly infected. Infection will cause infected leaves to wither and die, indirectly affecting yield.
In severe cases, blossoms and fruit can also be infected, directly reducing yield.

Symptoms and Signs

Pale greenish-yellow spots, usually less than 1/4 inch, with no definite margins, form on the upper sides of leaves. Olive-green to brown velvety mold forms on the lower leaf surface below leaf spots. Leaf spots grow together and turn brown.
