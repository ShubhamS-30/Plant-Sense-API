Tomato red spider mite, (Tetranychus evansi) is a small, red coloured arachnid that feeds on the sap of plants. The vegetable crops of tomato, eggplant and potato are among the hosts of tomato red spider mite.

Symptoms and Signs

The tomato red spider mite can be found on both sides of leaves but it prefers the undersides near the leaf veins. Feeding causes leaves to become yellowish white and mottled. Tomato red spider mite produces webbing, especially on the undersides of leaves. In high infestations, dense webbing can mummify plants.
