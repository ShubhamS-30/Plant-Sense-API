Black rot is caused by the bacteria Xanthamonas campestris pv campestris. This bacteria can infect any plant in the Brassica family, but tends to be most damaging in broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and kale. Black rot often enters farms and gardens via infected seed.

Symptoms and Signs

Initially, symptoms begin as yellowing at leaf edges, which turns into characteristic V-shaped lesions. As symptoms progress, plants can develop blackened vascular tissue and head rot. Plants can be affected at any stage of maturity.
