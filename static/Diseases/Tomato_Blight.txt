Tomato_BlightTomato blight (also known as late blight) is a disease caused by a fungus-like (Oomycete) organism that spreads rapidly through the foliage and fruit of tomatoes in warm, wet weather, causing collapse and decay.

Symptoms and Signs

Plants infected with early blight develop small black or brown spots, usually about 0.25 to 0.5 inch (6â€“12 mm) in diameter, on leaves, stems, and fruit. Leaf spots are leathery and often have a concentric ring pattern. They usually appear on older leaves first.
