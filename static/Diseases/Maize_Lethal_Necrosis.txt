Maize lethal necrosis disease is a viral disease affecting maize (corn) predominantly in East Africa, Southeast Asia and South America, which was recognised in 2010. It is caused by simultaneous infection with two viruses, MCMoV and any of several Potyviridae.

Symptoms and Signs

As the disease advances, the maize leaves become yellow and dry out from the outside edges towards the midrib.It can also cause dwarfing and premature aging of the plants. Finally, the entire plant dries out and dies. Dead plants can then be seen scattered across the field among healthy looking plants.
